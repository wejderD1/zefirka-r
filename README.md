# Zefirka üç¨

Zefirka is a web application for an online confectionery that allows users to order delicious desserts online. The app provides a user-friendly interface for browsing the product catalog, adding items to the cart, and placing orders. The project is built using modern web technologies to create a smooth and secure user experience.

## Technologies

Zefirka is developed using the following technologies:

- **React.js** ‚Äî a library for building user interfaces based on components. React helps to create scalable and efficient interfaces with a high level of user interaction.
- **Redux.js** ‚Äî a library for managing application state. Redux is used to store and manage global state (such as user data, items in the cart), ensuring predictable behavior and easier debugging.
- **Express.js** ‚Äî a server framework for Node.js, used for handling HTTP requests, routing, and database interaction. In Zefirka, Express handles the backend logic and APIs for client-server communication. Methods are used: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
- **Jest.js** ‚Äî a JavaScript testing framework. Jest is used for unit and integration testing of React components and other parts of the application, ensuring code stability and reliability.
- **Sass** ‚Äî a CSS preprocessor that simplifies writing styles. Sass allows for more modular and maintainable style code through variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **uuid** ‚Äî a library for generating unique identifiers. It is used to create unique keys for React components or other data that require uniqueness.
- **Nodemailer** ‚Äî a library for sending emails from the server. In Zefirka, it's used for sending order confirmation emails or other notifications to users.
